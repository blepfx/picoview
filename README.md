# picoview
Smol low-level windowing abstraction with a focus on audio plugin development 

> [!WARNING]
> This project is currently in development and the API is not final! Please do not rely on `picoview` in production.

## Goals

- Small API surface
- Minimal amount of dependencies 
- Complete OS abstraction
    - This includes abstracting away OS-dependent pixel scaling and only dealing with physical pixels. `picoview` provides a `WindowScale` event, which is treated as a hint more than anything else.

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for more info.
